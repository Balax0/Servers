so, this will be my sample doc about the process i have done to setup the dns, dhcp, web server
client - for my client im gonna use kali linux i already have it, so im gonna use it as client
server - for my server im installing ubuntu server 22.04, which i get to know about from the youtube walkthrough videos 

> i need to make sure that both my client (kali) and server (ubuntu) should be in a same lan network

> to make that i think i need to make some changes in my virtual box 

> after installation of ubuntu server i should install "bind9, bind9util, bind9doc" for dns setup, 
and for dhcp "isc-dhcp-server" 
and for web server "apache2"

and there are online resources that helped me to setup the servers if possible ill share the exact links of the resources

and for my vm's setup my kali is running in 1.5gb of ram and 20gb of storage
for my server ubuntu im planning to allocate the same ram and storage memory, hence i only have a 8gb ram in my actuall laptop pc.


--------------------server username and password (user name server, pass - server, server-ub )--------------------------------------------
okay, i have done my vm server installation
now lets proceed with the server setups

lets starts with the dhcp server setup
>> packages to be installed - isc-dhcp-server 

>> and to use ifconfig we should install nettools

>> nic add -- enp0s3 
>> sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server  > enter
  change the settings 
  interfacesv4= " enp0s3 "

>>main dhcp file configuration
  cd /etc/dhcp/
  ls
  sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf  > enter
  update subnetting options
  subnet 10.0.2.1  netmask 255.255.255.0
>>command the dns, dn because we doesnt have a dns server yet( hence it is dhcp server connection)
  option subnetmask 255.255.255.0
  option boardcast 10.0.2.255
  crtl o enter crtl x

>> start the server 
sudo start isc-dhcp-server
sudo status "  "   "

after get into the client os to establish the connection
login into kali machine ( my client ) 

check ifconfig
>> sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
>>update -- auto eth0, iface eth0 inet dhcp

## troubleshooting is going on >i cant find the dhcp server with my client server its been 2 hrs still troubleshooting going on
that problem is i cant connect the two vms in a same network
 
>>to trouble shoot any errors in dhcpd.conf use " sudo dhcpd -t -cf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf "
hence it helped me to solve the problem

finally found the error because of a " ; " .  :( :(

>> type systemctl status networking.service
and got the service running 
now my kali linux got the ip of 10.0.2.101/24, 10.0.2.255
