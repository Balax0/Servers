so, this will be my sample doc about the process i have done to setup the dns, dhcp, web server
client - for my client im gonna use kali linux i already have it, so im gonna use it as client
server - for my server im installing ubuntu server 22.04, which i get to know about from the youtube walkthrough videos 

> i need to make sure that both my client (kali) and server (ubuntu) should be in a same lan network

> to make that i think i need to make some changes in my virtual box 

> after installation of ubuntu server i should install "bind9, bind9util, bind9doc" for dns setup, 
and for dhcp "isc-dhcp-server" 
and for web server "apache2"

and there are online resources that helped me to setup the servers if possible ill share the exact links of the resources

and for my vm's setup my kali is running in 1.5gb of ram and 20gb of storage
for my server ubuntu im planning to allocate the same ram and storage memory, hence i only have a 8gb ram in my actuall laptop pc.


--------------------server username and password (user name server, pass - server, server-ub )--------------------------------------------
okay, i have done my vm server installation
now lets proceed with the server setups

lets starts with the dhcp server setup
>> packages to be installed - isc-dhcp-server
